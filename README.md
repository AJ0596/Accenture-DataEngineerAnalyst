Welcome to this repository! 

This repo highlights two major data engineering projects I delivered during my time at **Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**, where I worked with enterprise clients in the banking and fintech sectors.

These projects showcase how I leveraged modern data architectures and ETL practices to solve large-scale challenges involving legacy modernization, cost reduction, and cloud migration.

To explore the projects:

- GoldenGate Remediation: Rebuilt 350+ ETL workflows to eliminate Oracle GoldenGate and modernize data delivery to 50+ downstream apps.
- Azure Data Mesh Integration: Migrated HR data pipelines from legacy infrastructure to Microsoft Azure, enabling real-time access and reducing delivery time from 4 hours to 30 minutes.

Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` with project-specific context, architecture, tools used, and key outcomes.

*Happy Exploring!*
